# Red Rocket
A small Arduino project which utilizes a few bit shift registers, a bunch of LEDs, and a potentiometer.

The initial idea was to make the rocket play a variety of different light patterns dependent on user input. Currently, you can only adjust the speed of a single pattern by turning the potentiometer.
